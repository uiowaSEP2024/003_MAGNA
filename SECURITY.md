# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, the project "Magna" is in its initial release phase. Therefore, we have only one version available for use. Future versions will be updated in this policy as they become available, including information on which versions are being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Magna, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible. Please send an email to the project maintainers at `teckenrod <treyeck2@gmail.com>` with the details of the vulnerability. We take all reports seriously and will investigate each report and respond as quickly as possible.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A clear and concise description of what the vulnerability is.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability or a proof-of-concept (if possible).
- Any potential impacts of the vulnerability.

We are committed to working with security researchers to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities that are reported to us.

### Response Expectations

After reporting a vulnerability, you can expect the following:
- Acknowledgement of your report within 48 hours.
- Regular updates on the progress of addressing the vulnerability, typically every 72 hours.
- An explanation of the decision if the report is accepted or declined.

We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities and working with us to help keep our project secure.
